# G2M_Insight_Cab_Investment
Data Science Project for Data Glacier.

In this project, I was to analyze data regarding two Cab firms in the United States. The data can be found in this repository and the master data was created through the merging of cab_data, transaction_id, customer_id, and city in Python.
Examples of insights I pulled from the data are profit analysis, transaction analysis, distance analysis and much more. 
In addition, hypothesis testing regarding the data was executed to see if there was a statistical relationship between each company's profit and gender of their customers.

EDA was done through Jupyter Notebook found in this repository coined "EDA"
